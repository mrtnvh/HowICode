# Principles

## 1. Future-friendly
> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
> writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
> your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
> preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

* Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
* Your code should look the same as the rest of the code in the project.
* Build like you're not going to be the only one working on this project.
* Expect project changes.
* Keep an eye out for the future.

## 2. Speed
Build for [web performance](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/awesome-wpo#articles).

Projects should always attempt to include some generic means by which source can be linted, tested and compressed in preparation for production use. For this task, [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) by Ben Alman is second to none.

Do what you want in development, but be sure remove all excess baggage for production.

## 3. Adapt
Keep your eyes open for news, opinions and studies. They could benefit your work.
